First of all, Happy Birthday haha (I know it's too earlyyy mb)<br>
This bday I want you to focus more on yourself and your opinions than others.
<br> Ik you are trying and ik its gonna take time but you are almost there, so yes congratulations on that!<br>
But still, don't let what others say impact you much, you do you alright?
<br>Second,Enjoy your day today (that day), have your favourite cake, watch your fav shows etc...<br>
Third, this is gonna sound corny, cringe wtv u call it, it was my duty to warn you... <br>
I felt like it was important to tell you how much you mean to me, especially today (any day tbh).<br>
You aren't useless, you are one of the smartest, wittiest and cool-ly weird person I have met, by weird I mean my kinda weird not like weird weird._. <br>
and you have always listened to me, understood me and supported me, so thank you for all of that.<br>
 I love you a lot (lot lot), regardless of however u are, idk there isn't even anything wrong with you lol, you are perfect for me, and am glad to have met you (fr fr).<br>
I hope you get everything you wish for, have a great day today (that day, bday wala day) and a great year ahead, and and, 
<br>I hope you are happy and healthy always.<br>
Once again, I love you (more) and I miss you moreee! (always, except when we are together)<br>
